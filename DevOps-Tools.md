# [fit] Deckset
# [fit] has something
# [fit] for **_you_**…

# [fit] Here is
# [fit] The lowdown

---

# [fit] **_1_**

---

# [fit] Add _**[fit]**_

---

# [fit] To the start
# [fit] of any headline

---

# [fit] _**(After the hash & before the headline)**_
# [fit] _**Like so:**_ `# [fit] Your awesome headline`

---

# [fit] **_2_**

---

# [fit] Only
# [fit] use Headlines
# [fit] _**Start it with a # — no Paragraphs or lists within your slide**_

---

# [fit] If you do add something else, other than a headline…

We will assume you have more to say and we ignore the [fit] text as it would be pretty weird to squish so much stuff on a slide.
